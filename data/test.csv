#CHENEW",Chelsea
2468,2021-02-12 11:16:06,"Tuchel is sure Kai Havertz will come good: 'He is totally self-aware, very humble and super talented, and I am convinced he will have a big future at this club'.

#CHENEW",Chelsea
2469,2021-02-12 11:13:59,"Tuchel notes players like Hudson-Odoi can offer a threat from different parts of the pitch, giving us the possibility to react and be flexible. He adds the Academy is the backbone of any club and it was good to see three youngsters combine for the goal last night.

#CHENEW",Chelsea
2470,2021-02-12 11:08:42,"On the busy schedule, Tuchel recognises it would have been beneficial to have more time to work with his players on the training pitch, but he has 'got to know his team better' from matches and witnessed the spirit and mentality of his squad during tricky times. 

#CHENEW",Chelsea
2471,2021-02-12 11:05:07,"Tuchel says he will focus on the details from last night's game and won't be too critical of his players. His job is to help them understand what they can do better ahead of what he expects to be a tough challenge from Newcastle.

#CHENEW",Chelsea
2472,2021-02-12 11:02:07,"Tuchel starts with the latest team news. He confirms Christensen didn't suffer any sort of concussion last night, just a headache. Werner should be 'absolutely okay' to come back, but the game will be too soon for Thiago Silva and probably Havertz, too.

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2852,2021-01-28 13:58:51,"On Billy Gilmour, Tuchel says he is a 'strategic guy with a high level of understanding, and super quick with his feet and decision making'. He sees no reason for anyone in the squad to leave this month. 

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2853,2021-01-28 13:56:06,"Tuchel says he likes what he sees from Mount so far: 'His personality is amazing and he is such a competitive guy. He leaves his heart on the pitch and he cares for Chelsea 100 per cent. This is the best basis for big development.'

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2854,2021-01-28 13:54:12,"On Kante's best position, Tuchel thinks it is in a 'double six' in the middle of the pitch where we can use his energy and his range of attributes. 

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2855,2021-01-28 13:50:56,"Tuchel believes the Premier League brings the best out of coaches and players, and he expects it to do the same for him as he pits his wits against the best managers in the world.

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2856,2021-01-28 13:48:44,"Tuchel says it is a 'big, big challenge' to take over a team in the middle of the season, especially this one. He says we will miss the supporters in the stadium, and also because of social distancing rules at Cobham it is harder to create a bond between everyone.

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2857,2021-01-28 13:43:55,"Tuchel: 'People should be excited to come to Stamford Bridge and watch our team, and see a team playing with a special kind of energy and atmosphere, but at Chelsea we play for trophies and titles, we don't hide from that.'

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2858,2021-01-28 13:42:33,"Tuchel says he is happy with the squad size and adds Kante returned to training today so he has 22 outfield players to pick from. He thinks that is a good number considering our busy schedule and the fact we are in three different competitions. 

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2859,2021-01-28 13:40:41,"Tuchel hopes the Chelsea supporters will get behind him, and he completely understands why some will be disappointed Frank Lampard left. Tuchel reveals he received a message from Lampard today wishing him luck: 'I have the biggest respect for him and his legacy.'

#WelcomeTuchel",Chelsea
2860,2021-01-28 13:37:48,"Tuchel starts by saying he 'absolutely couldn't miss the chance to join one of the biggest clubs in the world' and it was an 'easy choice'. He says he has big ambitions and his first days have been 'amazing'.

806,2021-05-21 12:52:05,"PEP 💬 {@aguerosergiokun is} like a lion in the jungle, he kills the opponent.

The last goal versus Palace defined him. He controlled two or three steps then wow. So much speed and then the quality to make the goal, he has this quality. He could play till 40 and score goals.",Manchester City
807,2021-05-21 12:50:44,"PEP 💬 {@PhilFoden is} a guy who likes to play football 24 hours a day. His career is in the good moments but bad moments will come. Now is the moment to understand how diffcult this business is. I'm sure he’s humble, and the guys want the best for him.",Manchester City
808,2021-05-21 12:48:06,"PEP 💬 {@rubendias' #FOTY21 award} was unexpected honestly, we knew his quality but you never know.

@kylewalker2 couldn't play against Brighton because of a twist in his ankle playing with his boys.",Manchester City
811,2021-05-21 12:43:58,"PEP 💬 I don’t want to talk about {other teams' players), we are here for one game versus Everton, we respect the competition, they are playing for Europe. We have an important #UCL game too, it’s not nice for me to talk about that right now.",Manchester City
812,2021-05-21 12:42:43,"PEP 💬 He was incredibly loved by the backroom staff.

Sunday’s the last game, I’m sure the fans will give him a tribute to what he has done so far; titles, numbers, performances, incredible.",Manchester City
813,2021-05-21 12:41:31,"PEP 💬 {@aguerosergiokun is} an incredibly nice and funny person, humble being the legend he is. Being from Argentina and in this country where it’s so diffcult to score goals he’s done it for many years.",Manchester City

Kevin is important everyone knows it but everyone is at the same level, we will see his level and see if he is fit to play.",Manchester City

928,2021-05-17 12:34:08,PEP 💬 We use him in that position because in a long period of the season Gabriel and Sergio were injured. Some games we need a proper striker and we use him and he did well. His position is a winger of course but it’s an alternative. That’s all.,Manchester City

Our success is dedicated to him supporting me. Saying that we now have two weeks before a dream come true in the #UCL final.",Manchester City

I am most proud of sustaining the work ethic. I never expected when I arrived because I know how this country changes but we were always there.",Manchester City

1387,2021-04-28 22:04:48,PEP 💬 I was happy in the locker room and after the players were just calm. Not cheering just calm. Anything can happen in the second leg. Now we go to Palace to make an important step in the Premier League.,Manchester City
1388,2021-04-28 22:03:43,"PEP 💬 They're so incredibly dangerous with Mbappe in behind. But we found the goals and could've scored more. Just half of the job done. If we play shy and not who we are, anything can happen. But if we play who we are, maybe we have the chance to reach the final. https://t.co/AV0Hvkg8FO",Manchester City

1789,2021-04-16 12:45:06,PEP 💬  The important thing is fighting every year to be there. For the players in the past who could not do it I am more than delighted for them to reach the semis. We would love to reach the FA Cup final. After that we focus on Villa and then PSG.,Manchester City
1790,2021-04-16 12:44:00,"PEP 💬 Sometimes, when it is tough, and you need time and you spend a lot of years to get something, you give more value. That is why it is so nice. It is like life. Everything you get without effort is not nice. We know how difficult it was to reach the semi finals.",Manchester City
1791,2021-04-16 12:40:05,PEP 💬 Every manager plays the way they believe. Frank did an incredible job. First season he couldn't sign players. He had an incredible run in the Champions League. I admire them both. Tomorrow I face Thomas. He knows how much I admire him. It will be a good battle.,Manchester City
1792,2021-04-16 12:39:24,"PEP 💬 Arriving ahead of the next six weeks in the best condition. He extended his contract, it is not just good for him, but his family and ourselves. Hopefully he can keep his level.",Manchester City
1793,2021-04-16 12:39:03,"PEP 💬 He [De Bruyne] is arriving in a good mood. Against Leicester after the international break he was outstanding. He didn’t play against Leeds, I tried to have everyone involved. In Dortmund he played well.",Manchester City
1794,2021-04-16 12:36:10,"PEP 💬 You know my answer to this lovely question. We are not in the position to look much further. You want to talk about the future, but the reality is the training today and tomorrow. That is my only concern. The rest, I couldn't care less.",Manchester City
1795,2021-04-16 12:35:38,PEP 💬 Yeah. Maybe I am going to play the best team on the pitch to win the game. I am pretty sure tomorrow I will play the best team to win tomorrow.,Manchester City
1796,2021-04-16 12:35:19,"PEP 💬 It is much, much, much easier. Imagine playing this game after not qualifying for the UCL semis, it would be much tougher. I would love to have more days to recover and prepare, but the schedule is the schedule. You handle the schedule.",Manchester City
1797,2021-04-16 12:34:53,PEP 💬 After he went to Dortmund. The way he wants to play is so quick. It is tough to take over a team in the season. But he has a lot of experience being at a top club like PSG and now Chelsea. I knew from the beginning that he would do a good job. [Tuchel],Manchester City
1798,2021-04-16 12:34:14,"PEP 💬 If you know the trajectory of the team with the selections, the answer is obvious. Of course they can play together. It is obvious. Phil can play in five positions. Sterling can play in three positions. Everyone can play different positions. It depends on them.",Manchester City
1799,2021-04-16 12:33:48,"PEP 💬 It is the only way they can win all the present and win all the future. With Phil in that case, everything we get right now is on the grass. You have to do something to win every game to stay in the team.",Manchester City
1800,2021-04-16 12:33:27,PEP 💬 It is not about what we believe in the past. It is about what they show on the grass. Footballers have to show every day. Journalists talk a lot about the past and the future but it is about what we have to do today. They have to talk on the grass.,Manchester City
1801,2021-04-16 12:32:45,"PEP 💬 No not, yet. [Aguero back]

Yeah, they [rest of squad] are okay. Tired, but in a good mood. They are okay.",Manchester City

2650,2021-03-15 12:52:23,"PEP 💬 Right now (this City team) is worse than the previous ones because the other ones won a lot and this team hasn’t won anything. 

We are validated for the trophies we can win, especially from the outside. The previous teams won. This team has to prove it.",Manchester City
2651,2021-03-15 12:50:50,"PEP 💬 Four titles has never happened before and I don’t think it will happen this season with the situation. The only thing to think about is this game and then Everton.

I don’t know what will happen at the end of the season, but normally, it does not happen.",Manchester City
2652,2021-03-15 12:48:23,"PEP 💬 Sterling travels with the team. All the squad travel to Budapest.

2653,2021-03-15 12:40:22,"OLEKS 💬 Ruden Dias is so important for us. Since he came we have had that confidence. 

The job John Stones, Joao Cancelo, Walker and the other defenders have done is incredible. The main reason I would say (that we are more solid in defence) is because we have worked so hard.",Manchester City
2654,2021-03-15 12:37:33,"OLEKS 💬 We have got an unbelievable squad. Everyone deserves to play. You are just fighting for your chance to show your quality, your class and to show you deserve to play another game. We are pushing each other. It is extra motivation. We move each other forward.",Manchester City
2655,2021-03-15 12:36:16,"OLEKS 💬 Inside the dressing room, I can see the hungry eyes. Everyone is so hungry for the titles. That is what we want.

2656,2021-03-15 12:33:04,"OLEKS 💬 Bayern Munich showed last year, they won everything. Barcelona did it with Pep. Of course, everything is possible. We have got an unbelievable squad, the best players in the world? Definitely, why not?",Manchester City
2657,2021-03-15 12:32:16,"First-up it's Oleks Zinchenko...

2759,2021-03-12 13:45:24,"PEP 💬 Why do you not have to play football? Maybe I'm wrong, but these guys are saying to their team, you're good enough to go there to try and win the game. Other managers say now, we're going to sit back. Scott Parker went to Anfield and tried to play. That's quite remarkable.",Manchester City
2760,2021-03-12 13:42:52,"PEP 💬 They are working a lot to find a solution, but the grass isn’t good. All the players know how good the grass is and sometimes it is not. There are stadiums where the grass is good. Arsenal, Anfield, Old Trafford - even Budapest, the grass is better. Our grass is not good.",Manchester City
2761,2021-03-12 13:41:15,"PEP 💬 He [Parker] is younger. He has hair. He is better than me, definitely. I accept a draw against him! [Best dressed manager]",Manchester City
2762,2021-03-12 13:40:36,"PEP 💬 Sometimes the players have the ability to provoke falls. This is a talent too. It is the refs job to decide. It is one of the toughest jobs they have. The game is faster than ever. That is why VAR is there, to wait ten seconds and have a look.",Manchester City
2763,2021-03-12 13:39:29,PEP 💬 Nobody guaranteed with 11 players in the 18 yard box that you’ll have the success to win. Nobody knows that. That's why I prefer it as a spectator. I think all the new generation of managers are saying we’ll do our game rather than wait to see what the opponents do.,Manchester City
2764,2021-03-12 13:38:40,PEP 💬 Okay. Just defend with ten players behind the 18-yard box. They can do that. If I was a spectator I would prefer to watch the first fifteen minutes of Southampton. They have the courage to play. That doesn’t mean you don’t defend.,Manchester City
2765,2021-03-12 13:37:46,"PEP 💬  All the new generation of managers have this quality. All the managers in Germany and Spain play like they manage Bayern Munich. Sometimes they can't do it. You have the idea that you are going to lose a lot of games, but you are going win the games you need to.",Manchester City
2766,2021-03-12 13:36:36,"PEP 💬 A lot. It is what I admire the most. What I admire is that when it is not going well they continue to do it and at the end the results come. They make the sport nice, when both teams want to attack and create, not just wait for one mistake.",Manchester City
2767,2021-03-12 13:35:55,"PEP 💬 I'm going to tell you a secret, the Manager of the Month and Player of the Month is because we win games. It is not that Gundo is better than another player in the league or I'm a better manager. It's simply, the players behind and the backroom staff who help us win games.",Manchester City
2768,2021-03-12 13:34:34,"PEP 💬 In my fifth season in England, I have never seen the lower teams with this quality of play. We saw it with Southampton. The way they play is incredible. I saw it here with Fulham. The pace they play with, the organisation.",Manchester City
2769,2021-03-12 13:33:47,"PEP 💬 Since day one, they have played incredibly well. They were relegated with Scott and at the end of the season they were promoted. In English football there are incredibly good managers with Mr Potter at Brighton and Scott at Fulham. Many of them have courage to play.",Manchester City
2770,2021-03-12 13:32:28,"PEP 💬 If he [Wilder] was here, he would be fighting for the title. If i was in Sheffield I maybe would be fighting relegation.",Manchester City
2771,2021-03-12 13:31:56,PEP 💬 Right now it is not official. My press officer told me it is not official. I prefer not to comment on that. I have a good relationship with him when we faced each other. I wish him all the best if he is still there [Chris Wilder].,Manchester City

2909,2021-03-09 13:36:15,PEP 💬 It’s not a bad moment. A bad moment is playing bad and not getting results in a lot of games. We are close - every team is fighting for something. We are seeing how tough the games are. Tomorrow will not be an exception.,Manchester City
